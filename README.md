# Tutorials

A collection of tutorials, in the form of Jupyter notebooks, to help people getting started with Machine Learning in Python. Some emphasis is put on the theoretical aspect behind what the code does and sometimes tasks are performed first using low-level tools (e.g. ScyPy) and then with more high-level ones (e.g. SKLearn).

## Topics covered

* Linear regression and binary classification.
* Neural network basics: using Keras layers with TensorFlow (explicitely copied from https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html).
